# SGLFormer: Spiking Global-Local-Fusion Transformer with High Performance, [This is Link]( https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2024.1371290)
Our models achieve SOTA performance on several datasets (eg. 83.73 % on ImageNet, 96.76 % on CIFAR10, 82.26 % on CIFAR100, 82.9% on CIFAR10-DVS) in directly trained SNNs in 2024/03.
